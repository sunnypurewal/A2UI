# A2UI Swift Sample Client

This directory contains a sample iOS application that demonstrates how to use the A2UI Swift renderer.

The project is located in `A2UISampleApp/` and can be opened with Xcode.

## Purpose

This sample app serves as a practical example and testbed for the Swift renderer located in `renderers/swift`. It includes:

-   A gallery of different A2UI responses.
-   An integration of the `A2UISurfaceView` to render the responses.
-   A button to view the raw A2UI JSON for each example.
